The gist of part 1 is that you are given a bunch of strings that contain the pattern "mul(N,M)", where N and M are integers, interspersed among a load of nonsense (Part 2 will probably reveal that the nonsense is no such thing, let's wait and see). The task is to extract all matching patterns, calculate N*M for each one, and return all these results added together.

In part 2 there are some other instructions strewn throughout the nonsense. In particular, the patterns "do()" and "don't()". Any "mul(N,M)"s encountered after a "don't()" should be ignored, whereas any that come after a "do()" should count. Otherwise it's the same as part 1 (but the total will end up being smaller).
